# Project: React Immutable Utilities

Welcome to the React Immutable Utilities project! This repository contains a collection of functions and utilities aimed at enhancing the immutability of objects and data structures in React applications using the Immutable.js library.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/alx-react
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd alx-react/0x06-React_Immutable
```

3. Copy the necessary config files specified in the description to the root directory of the project and execute npm install.

## Functionality

### 0. Converting into an Immutable object using fromJS

**File:** 0-fromjs.js

Converts a plain JavaScript object into an immutable Map using the `fromJS` function from the Immutable.js library.

### 1. Converting into Immutable using Map

**File:** 1-map.js

Converts a plain JavaScript object into an immutable Map using the `Map` function from the Immutable.js library.

### 2. Accessing nested elements

**File:** 2-nested.js

Retrieves the value of a nested key within an object, given a path to that key.

### 3. List and push

**File:** 3-list.js

Provides functions to convert an array into an immutable List and to add elements to the List.

### 4. Chained mutations

**File:** 4-mutations.js

Demonstrates chained mutations on an Immutable Map.

### 5. Merge & concat

**File:** 5-merge.js

Defines functions to merge and concatenate elements using Immutable.js List and Map.

### 6. Nested merge

**File:** 6-deeply.js

Merges nested objects deeply into a single object using Immutable.js Map.

### 7. Equality

**File:** 7-equality.js

Checks the equality of two Immutable Maps using Immutable.js `is` function.

### 8. Lazy Seq

**File:** 8-seq.js

Filters and prints best students from a grades object using Immutable.js Seq.
